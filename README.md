# CDA Project Repo - Exploring Clustering-Based Hybrid Recommendation System on the Bookcrossing Dataset

Team members: Garrison M. Winter, Molly E. Bartley, Samuel Wade Wang

This repository will be used to host our code files.

## Getting started

1. First, git clone this repository:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:ZebraAlgebra/cda-project.git
```

2. Download the following datasets to the `Data/Raw` directory (this directory is included in `.gitignore` by default):

   1. [The Bookcrossing Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/somnambwl/bookcrossing-dataset).
   1. [The Goodreads Dataset](https://datarepo.eng.ucsd.edu/mcauley_group/gdrive/goodreads/). Mainly, download the ones marked with
   1. Potentially, we are interested in the [OpenLibrary Datadump](https://archive.org/details/ol_dump_2024-02-29), but at this stage, let us not do anything with it (the data is unclean, and is huge).

1. (Optional) If you are a python user that uses virtual environments to manage the dependencies of your project, you can initialize one here, and activate it here (the steps are dependent on the system though).

1. Install the dependencies via:

```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

yah that should get the project started.
